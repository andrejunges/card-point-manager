118061 silly install resolved     readme: '# amdefine\n\nA module that can be used to implement AMD\'s define() in Node. This allows you\nto code to the AMD API and have the module work in node programs without\nrequiring those other programs to use AMD.\n\n## Usage\n\n**1)** Update your package.json to indicate amdefine as a dependency:\n\n```javascript\n    "dependencies": {\n        "amdefine": ">=0.1.0"\n    }\n```\n\nThen run `npm install` to get amdefine into your project.\n\n**2)** At the top of each module that uses define(), place this code:\n\n```javascript\nif (typeof define !== \'function\') { var define = require(\'amdefine\')(module) }\n```\n\n**Only use these snippets** when loading amdefine. If you preserve the basic structure,\nwith the braces, it will be stripped out when using the [RequireJS optimizer](#optimizer).\n\nYou can add spaces, line breaks and even require amdefine with a local path, but\nkeep the rest of the structure to get the stripping behavior.\n\nAs you may know, because `if` statements in JavaScript don\'t have their own scope, the var\ndeclaration in the above snippet is made whether the `if` expression is truthy or not. If\nRequireJS is loaded then the declaration is superfluous because `define` is already already\ndeclared in the same scope in RequireJS. Fortunately JavaScript handles multiple `var`\ndeclarations of the same variable in the same scope gracefully.\n\nIf you want to deliver amdefine.js with your code rather than specifying it as a dependency\nwith npm, then just download the latest release and refer to it using a relative path:\n\n[Latest Version](https://github.com/jrburke/amdefine/raw/latest/amdefine.js)\n\n### amdefine/intercept\n\nConsider this very experimental.\n\nInstead of pasting the piece of text for the amdefine setup of a `define`\nvariable in each module you create or consume, you can use `amdefine/intercept`\ninstead. It will automatically insert the above snippet in each .js file loaded\nby Node.\n\n**Warning**: you should only use this if you are creating an application that\nis consuming AMD style defined()\'d modules that are distributed via npm and want\nto run that code in Node.\n\nFor library code where you are not sure if it will be used by others in Node or\nin the browser, then explicitly depending on amdefine and placing the code\nsnippet above is suggested path, instead of using `amdefine/intercept`. The\nintercept module affects all .js files loaded in the Node app, and it is\ninconsiderate to modify global state like that unless you are also controlling\nthe top level app.\n\n#### Why distribute AMD-style nodes via npm?\n\nnpm has a lot of weaknesses for front-end use (installed layout is not great,\nshould have better support for the `baseUrl + moduleID + \'.js\' style of loading,\nsingle file JS installs), but some people want a JS package manager and are\nwilling to live with those constraints. If that is you, but still want to author\nin AMD style modules to get dynamic require([]), better direct source usage and\npowerful loader plugin support in the browser, then this tool can help.\n\n#### amdefine/intercept usage\n\nJust require it in your top level app module (for example index.js, server.js):\n\n```javascript\nrequire(\'amdefine/intercept\');\n```\n\nThe module does not return a value, so no need to assign the result to a local\nvariable.\n\nThen just require() code as you normally would with Node\'s require(). Any .js\nloaded after the intercept require will have the amdefine check injected in\nthe .js source as it is loaded. It does not modify the source on disk, just\nprepends some content to the text of the module as it is loaded by Node.\n\n#### How amdefine/intercept works\n\nIt overrides the `Module._extensions[\'.js\']` in Node to automatically prepend\nthe amdefine snippet above. So, it will affect any .js file loaded by your\napp.\n\n## define() usage\n\nIt is best if you use the anonymous forms of define() in your module:\n\n```javascript\ndefine(function (require) {\n    var dependency = require(\'dependency\');\n});\n```\n\nor\n\n```javascript\ndefine([\'dependency\'], function (dependency) {\n\n});\n```\n\n## RequireJS optimizer integration. <a name="optimizer"></name>\n\nVersion 1.0.3 of the [RequireJS optimizer](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html)\nwill have support for stripping the `if (typeof define !== \'function\')` check\nmentioned above, so you can include this snippet for code that runs in the\nbrowser, but avoid taking the cost of the if() statement once the code is\noptimized for deployment.\n\n## Node 0.4 Support\n\nIf you want to support Node 0.4, then add `require` as the second parameter to amdefine:\n\n```javascript\n//Only if you want Node 0.4. If using 0.5 or later, use the above snippet.\nif (typeof define !== \'function\') { var define = require(\'amdefine\')(module, require) }\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\n### Synchronous vs Asynchronous\n\namdefine creates a define() function that is callable by your code. It will\nexecute and trace dependencies and call the factory function *synchronously*,\nto keep the behavior in line with Node\'s synchronous dependency tracing.\n\nThe exception: calling AMD\'s callback-style require() from inside a factory\nfunction. The require callback is called on process.nextTick():\n\n```javascript\ndefine(function (require) {\n    require([\'a\'], function(a) {\n        //\'a\' is loaded synchronously, but\n        //this callback is called on process.nextTick().\n    });\n});\n```\n\n### Loader Plugins\n\nLoader plugins are supported as long as they call their load() callbacks\nsynchronously. So ones that do network requests will not work. However plugins\nlike [text](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#text) can load text files locally.\n\nThe plugin API\'s `load.fromText()` is **not supported** in amdefine, so this means\ntranspiler plugins like the [CoffeeScript loader plugin](https://github.com/jrburke/require-cs)\nwill not work. This may be fixable, but it is a bit complex, and I do not have\nenough node-fu to figure it out yet. See the source for amdefine.js if you want\nto get an idea of the issues involved.\n\n## Tests\n\nTo run the tests, cd to **tests** and run:\n\n```\nnode all.js\nnode all-intercept.js\n```\n\n## License\n\nNew BSD and MIT. Check the LICENSE file for all the details.\n',

118568 silly install resolved     readme: '[RFC6265](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265) Cookies and CookieJar for Node.js\n\n![Tough Cookie](http://www.goinstant.com.s3.amazonaws.com/tough-cookie.jpg)\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/goinstant/node-cookie.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/goinstant/node-cookie)\n\n[![NPM Stats](https://nodei.co/npm/tough-cookie.png?downloads=true&stars=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/tough-cookie)\n![NPM Downloads](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/tough-cookie.png?months=9)\n\n# Synopsis\n\n``` javascript\nvar tough = require(\'tough-cookie\'); // note: not \'cookie\', \'cookies\' or \'node-cookie\'\nvar Cookie = tough.Cookie;\nvar cookie = Cookie.parse(header);\ncookie.value = \'somethingdifferent\';\nheader = cookie.toString();\n\nvar cookiejar = new tough.CookieJar();\ncookiejar.setCookie(cookie, \'http://currentdomain.example.com/path\', cb);\n// ...\ncookiejar.getCookies(\'http://example.com/otherpath\',function(err,cookies) {\n  res.headers[\'cookie\'] = cookies.join(\'; \');\n});\n```\n\n# Installation\n\nIt\'s _so_ easy!\n\n`npm install tough-cookie`\n\nRequires `punycode`, which should get installed automatically for you.  Note that node.js v0.6.2+ bundles punycode by default.\n\nWhy the name?  NPM modules `cookie`, `cookies` and `cookiejar` were already taken.\n\n# API\n\ntough\n=====\n\nFunctions on the module you get from `require(\'tough-cookie\')`.  All can be used as pure functions and don\'t need to be "bound".\n\nparseDate(string[,strict])\n-----------------\n\nParse a cookie date string into a `Date`.  Parses according to RFC6265 Section 5.1.1, not `Date.parse()`.  If strict is set to true then leading/trailing non-seperator characters around the time part will cause the parsing to fail (e.g. "Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:010 GMT" has an extra trailing zero but Chrome, an assumedly RFC-compliant browser, treats this as valid).\n\nformatDate(date)\n----------------\n\nFormat a Date into a RFC1123 string (the RFC6265-recommended format).\n\ncanonicalDomain(str)\n--------------------\n\nTransforms a domain-name into a canonical domain-name.  The canonical domain-name is a trimmed, lowercased, stripped-of-leading-dot and optionally punycode-encoded domain-name (Section 5.1.2 of RFC6265).  For the most part, this function is idempotent (can be run again on its output without ill effects).\n\ndomainMatch(str,domStr[,canonicalize=true])\n-------------------------------------------\n\nAnswers "does this real domain match the domain in a cookie?".  The `str` is the "current" domain-name and the `domStr` is the "cookie" domain-name.  Matches according to RFC6265 Section 5.1.3, but it helps to think of it as a "suffix match".\n\nThe `canonicalize` parameter will run the other two paramters through `canonicalDomain` or not.\n\ndefaultPath(path)\n-----------------\n\nGiven a current request/response path, gives the Path apropriate for storing in a cookie.  This is basically the "directory" of a "file" in the path, but is specified by Section 5.1.4 of the RFC.\n\nThe `path` parameter MUST be _only_ the pathname part of a URI (i.e. excludes the hostname, query, fragment, etc.).  This is the `.pathname` property of node\'s `uri.parse()` output.\n\npathMatch(reqPath,cookiePath)\n-----------------------------\n\nAnswers "does the request-path path-match a given cookie-path?" as per RFC6265 Section 5.1.4.  Returns a boolean.\n\nThis is essentially a prefix-match where `cookiePath` is a prefix of `reqPath`.\n\nparse(header[,strict=false])\n----------------------------\n\nalias for `Cookie.parse(header[,strict])`\n\nfromJSON(string)\n----------------\n\nalias for `Cookie.fromJSON(string)`\n\ngetPublicSuffix(hostname)\n-------------------------\n\nReturns the public suffix of this hostname.  The public suffix is the shortest domain-name upon which a cookie can be set.  Returns `null` if the hostname cannot have cookies set for it.\n\nFor example: `www.example.com` and `www.subdomain.example.com` both have public suffix `example.com`.\n\nFor further information, see http://publicsuffix.org/.  This module derives its list from that site.\n\ncookieCompare(a,b)\n------------------\n\nFor use with `.sort()`, sorts a list of cookies into the recommended order given in the RFC (Section 5.4 step 2).  Longest `.path`s go first, then sorted oldest to youngest.\n\n``` javascript\nvar cookies = [ /* unsorted array of Cookie objects */ ];\ncookies = cookies.sort(cookieCompare);\n```\n\npermuteDomain(domain)\n---------------------\n\nGenerates a list of all possible domains that `domainMatch()` the parameter.  May be handy for implementing cookie stores.\n\n\npermutePath(path)\n-----------------\n\nGenerates a list of all possible paths that `pathMatch()` the parameter.  May be handy for implementing cookie stores.\n\nCookie\n======\n\nCookie.parse(header[,strict=false])\n-----------------------------------\n\nParses a single Cookie or Set-Cookie HTTP header into a `Cookie` object.  Returns `undefined` if the string can\'t be parsed.  If in strict mode, returns `undefined` if the cookie doesn\'t follow the guidelines in section 4 of RFC6265.  Generally speaking, strict mode can be used to validate your own generated Set-Cookie headers, but acting as a client you want to be lenient and leave strict mode off.\n\nHere\'s how to process the Set-Cookie header(s) on a node HTTP/HTTPS response:\n\n``` javascript\nif (res.headers[\'set-cookie\'] instanceof Array)\n  cookies = res.headers[\'set-cookie\'].map(function (c) { return (Cookie.parse(c)); });\nelse\n  cookies = [Cookie.parse(res.headers[\'set-cookie\'])];\n```\n\nCookie.fromJSON(string)\n-----------------------\n\nConvert a JSON string to a `Cookie` object.  Does a `JSON.parse()` and converts the `.created`, `.lastAccessed` and `.expires` properties into `Date` objects.\n\nProperties\n==========\n\n  * _key_ - string - the name or key of the cookie (default "")\n  * _value_ - string - the value of the cookie (default "")\n  * _expires_ - `Date` - if set, the `Expires=` attribute of the cookie (defaults to the string `"Infinity"`). See `setExpires()`\n  * _maxAge_ - seconds - if set, the `Max-Age=` attribute _in seconds_ of the cookie.  May also be set to strings `"Infinity"` and `"-Infinity"` for non-expiry and immediate-expiry, respectively.  See `setMaxAge()`\n  * _domain_ - string - the `Domain=` attribute of the cookie\n  * _path_ - string - the `Path=` of the cookie\n  * _secure_ - boolean - the `Secure` cookie flag\n  * _httpOnly_ - boolean - the `HttpOnly` cookie flag\n  * _extensions_ - `Array` - any unrecognized cookie attributes as strings (even if equal-signs inside)\n\nAfter a cookie has been passed through `CookieJar.setCookie()` it will have the following additional attributes:\n\n  * _hostOnly_ - boolean - is this a host-only cookie (i.e. no Domain field was set, but was instead implied)\n  * _pathIsDefault_ - boolean - if true, there was no Path field on the cookie and `defaultPath()` was used to derive one.\n  * _created_ - `Date` - when this cookie was added to the jar\n  * _lastAccessed_ - `Date` - last time the cookie got accessed. Will affect cookie cleaning once implemented.  Using `cookiejar.getCookies(...)` will update this attribute.\n\nConstruction([{options}])\n------------\n\nReceives an options object that can contain any Cookie properties, uses the default for unspecified properties.\n\n.toString()\n-----------\n\nencode to a Set-Cookie header value.  The Expires cookie field is set using `formatDate()`, but is omitted entirely if `.expires` is `Infinity`.\n\n.cookieString()\n---------------\n\nencode to a Cookie header value (i.e. the `.key` and `.value` properties joined with \'=\').\n\n.setExpires(String)\n-------------------\n\nsets the expiry based on a date-string passed through `parseDate()`.  If parseDate returns `null` (i.e. can\'t parse this date string), `.expires` is set to `"Infinity"` (a string) is set.\n\n.setMaxAge(number)\n-------------------\n\nsets the maxAge in seconds.  Coerces `-Infinity` to `"-Infinity"` and `Infinity` to `"Infinity"` so it JSON serializes correctly.\n\n.expiryTime([now=Date.now()])\n-----------------------------\n\n.expiryDate([now=Date.now()])\n-----------------------------\n\nexpiryTime() Computes the absolute unix-epoch milliseconds that this cookie expires. expiryDate() works similarly, except it returns a `Date` object.  Note that in both cases the `now` parameter should be milliseconds.\n\nMax-Age takes precedence over Expires (as per the RFC). The `.created` attribute -- or, by default, the `now` paramter -- is used to offset the `.maxAge` attribute.\n\nIf Expires (`.expires`) is set, that\'s returned.\n\nOtherwise, `expiryTime()` returns `Infinity` and `expiryDate()` returns a `Date` object for "Tue, 19 Jan 2038 03:14:07 GMT" (latest date that can be expressed by a 32-bit `time_t`; the common limit for most user-agents).\n\n.TTL([now=Date.now()])\n---------\n\ncompute the TTL relative to `now` (milliseconds).  The same precedence rules as for `expiryTime`/`expiryDate` apply.\n\nThe "number" `Infinity` is returned for cookies without an explicit expiry and `0` is returned if the cookie is expired.  Otherwise a time-to-live in milliseconds is returned.\n\n.canonicalizedDoman()\n---------------------\n\n.cdomain()\n----------\n\nreturn the canonicalized `.domain` field.  This is lower-cased and punycode (RFC3490) encoded if the domain has any non-ASCII characters.\n\n.validate()\n-----------\n\nStatus: *IN PROGRESS*. Works for a few things, but is by no means comprehensive.\n\nvalidates cookie attributes for semantic correctness.  Useful for "lint" checking any Set-Cookie headers you generate.  For now, it returns a boolean, but eventually could return a reason string -- you can future-proof with this construct:\n\n``` javascript\nif (cookie.validate() === true) {\n  // it\'s tasty\n} else {\n  // yuck!\n}\n```\n\nCookieJar\n=========\n\nConstruction([store = new MemoryCookieStore()][, rejectPublicSuffixes])\n------------\n\nSimply use `new CookieJar()`.  If you\'d like to use a custom store, pass that to the constructor otherwise a `MemoryCookieStore` will be created and used.\n\n\nAttributes\n----------\n\n  * _rejectPublicSuffixes_ - boolean - reject cookies with domains like "com" and "co.uk" (default: `true`)\n\nSince eventually this module would like to support database/remote/etc. CookieJars, continuation passing style is used for CookieJar methods.\n\n.setCookie(cookieOrString, currentUrl, [{options},] cb(err,cookie))\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAttempt to set the cookie in the cookie jar.  If the operation fails, an error will be given to the callback `cb`, otherwise the cookie is passed through.  The cookie will have updated `.created`, `.lastAccessed` and `.hostOnly` properties.\n\nThe `options` object can be omitted and can have the following properties:\n\n  * _http_ - boolean - default `true` - indicates if this is an HTTP or non-HTTP API.  Affects HttpOnly cookies.\n  * _secure_ - boolean - autodetect from url - indicates if this is a "Secure" API.  If the currentUrl starts with `https:` or `wss:` then this is defaulted to `true`, otherwise `false`.\n  * _now_ - Date - default `new Date()` - what to use for the creation/access time of cookies\n  * _strict_ - boolean - default `false` - perform extra checks\n  * _ignoreError_ - boolean - default `false` - silently ignore things like parse errors and invalid domains.  CookieStore errors aren\'t ignored by this option.\n\nAs per the RFC, the `.hostOnly` property is set if there was no "Domain=" parameter in the cookie string (or `.domain` was null on the Cookie object).  The `.domain` property is set to the fully-qualified hostname of `currentUrl` in this case.  Matching this cookie requires an exact hostname match (not a `domainMatch` as per usual).\n\n.setCookieSync(cookieOrString, currentUrl, [{options}])\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nSynchronous version of `setCookie`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n.storeCookie(cookie, [{options},] cb(err,cookie))\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n__REMOVED__ removed in lieu of the CookieStore API below\n\n.getCookies(currentUrl, [{options},] cb(err,cookies))\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nRetrieve the list of cookies that can be sent in a Cookie header for the current url.\n\nIf an error is encountered, that\'s passed as `err` to the callback, otherwise an `Array` of `Cookie` objects is passed.  The array is sorted with `cookieCompare()` unless the `{sort:false}` option is given.\n\nThe `options` object can be omitted and can have the following properties:\n\n  * _http_ - boolean - default `true` - indicates if this is an HTTP or non-HTTP API.  Affects HttpOnly cookies.\n  * _secure_ - boolean - autodetect from url - indicates if this is a "Secure" API.  If the currentUrl starts with `https:` or `wss:` then this is defaulted to `true`, otherwise `false`.\n  * _now_ - Date - default `new Date()` - what to use for the creation/access time of cookies\n  * _expire_ - boolean - default `true` - perform expiry-time checking of cookies and asynchronously remove expired cookies from the store.  Using `false` will return expired cookies and **not** remove them from the store (which is useful for replaying Set-Cookie headers, potentially).\n  * _allPaths_ - boolean - default `false` - if `true`, do not scope cookies by path. The default uses RFC-compliant path scoping. **Note**: may not be supported by the CookieStore `fetchCookies` function (the default MemoryCookieStore supports it).\n\nThe `.lastAccessed` property of the returned cookies will have been updated.\n\n.getCookiesSync(currentUrl, [{options}])\n----------------------------------------\n\nSynchronous version of `getCookies`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n.getCookieString(...)\n---------------------\n\nAccepts the same options as `.getCookies()` but passes a string suitable for a Cookie header rather than an array to the callback.  Simply maps the `Cookie` array via `.cookieString()`.\n\n.getCookieStringSync(...)\n-------------------------\n\nSynchronous version of `getCookieString`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n.getSetCookieStrings(...)\n-------------------------\n\nReturns an array of strings suitable for **Set-Cookie** headers. Accepts the same options as `.getCookies()`.  Simply maps the cookie array via `.toString()`.\n\n.getSetCookieStringsSync(...)\n-----------------------------\n\nSynchronous version of `getSetCookieStrings`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\nStore\n=====\n\nBase class for CookieJar stores.\n\n# CookieStore API\n\nThe storage model for each `CookieJar` instance can be replaced with a custom implementation.  The default is `MemoryCookieStore` which can be found in the `lib/memstore.js` file.  The API uses continuation-passing-style to allow for asynchronous stores.\n\nStores should inherit from the base `Store` class, which is available as `require(\'tough-cookie\').Store`.  Stores are asynchronous by default, but if `store.synchronous` is set, then the `*Sync` methods on the CookieJar can be used.\n\nAll `domain` parameters will have been normalized before calling.\n\nThe Cookie store must have all of the following methods.\n\nstore.findCookie(domain, path, key, cb(err,cookie))\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nRetrieve a cookie with the given domain, path and key (a.k.a. name).  The RFC maintains that exactly one of these cookies should exist in a store.  If the store is using versioning, this means that the latest/newest such cookie should be returned.\n\nCallback takes an error and the resulting `Cookie` object.  If no cookie is found then `null` MUST be passed instead (i.e. not an error).\n\nstore.findCookies(domain, path, cb(err,cookies))\n------------------------------------------------\n\nLocates cookies matching the given domain and path.  This is most often called in the context of `cookiejar.getCookies()` above.\n\nIf no cookies are found, the callback MUST be passed an empty array.\n\nThe resulting list will be checked for applicability to the current request according to the RFC (domain-match, path-match, http-only-flag, secure-flag, expiry, etc.), so it\'s OK to use an optimistic search algorithm when implementing this method.  However, the search algorithm used SHOULD try to find cookies that `domainMatch()` the domain and `pathMatch()` the path in order to limit the amount of checking that needs to be done.\n\nAs of version 0.9.12, the `allPaths` option to `cookiejar.getCookies()` above will cause the path here to be `null`.  If the path is `null`, path-matching MUST NOT be performed (i.e. domain-matching only).\n\nstore.putCookie(cookie, cb(err))\n--------------------------------\n\nAdds a new cookie to the store.  The implementation SHOULD replace any existing cookie with the same `.domain`, `.path`, and `.key` properties -- depending on the nature of the implementation, it\'s possible that between the call to `fetchCookie` and `putCookie` that a duplicate `putCookie` can occur.\n\nThe `cookie` object MUST NOT be modified; the caller will have already updated the `.creation` and `.lastAccessed` properties.\n\nPass an error if the cookie cannot be stored.\n\nstore.updateCookie(oldCookie, newCookie, cb(err))\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate an existing cookie.  The implementation MUST update the `.value` for a cookie with the same `domain`, `.path` and `.key`.  The implementation SHOULD check that the old value in the store is equivalent to `oldCookie` - how the conflict is resolved is up to the store.\n\nThe `.lastAccessed` property will always be different between the two objects and `.created` will always be the same.  Stores MAY ignore or defer the `.lastAccessed` change at the cost of affecting how cookies are sorted (or selected for deletion).\n\nStores may wish to optimize changing the `.value` of the cookie in the store versus storing a new cookie.  If the implementation doesn\'t define this method a stub that calls `putCookie(newCookie,cb)` will be added to the store object.\n\nThe `newCookie` and `oldCookie` objects MUST NOT be modified.\n\nPass an error if the newCookie cannot be stored.\n\nstore.removeCookie(domain, path, key, cb(err))\n----------------------------------------------\n\nRemove a cookie from the store (see notes on `findCookie` about the uniqueness constraint).\n\nThe implementation MUST NOT pass an error if the cookie doesn\'t exist; only pass an error due to the failure to remove an existing cookie.\n\nstore.removeCookies(domain, path, cb(err))\n------------------------------------------\n\nRemoves matching cookies from the store.  The `path` paramter is optional, and if missing means all paths in a domain should be removed.\n\nPass an error ONLY if removing any existing cookies failed.\n\n# TODO\n\n  * _full_ RFC5890/RFC5891 canonicalization for domains in `cdomain()`\n    * the optional `punycode` requirement implements RFC3492, but RFC6265 requires RFC5891\n  * better tests for `validate()`?\n\n# Copyright and License\n\n(tl;dr: MIT with some MPL/1.1)\n\nCopyright 2012- GoInstant, Inc. and other contributors.

119174 silly install resolved     readme: '# amdefine\n\nA module that can be used to implement AMD\'s define() in Node. This allows you\nto code to the AMD API and have the module work in node programs without\nrequiring those other programs to use AMD.\n\n## Usage\n\n**1)** Update your package.json to indicate amdefine as a dependency:\n\n```javascript\n    "dependencies": {\n        "amdefine": ">=0.1.0"\n    }\n```\n\nThen run `npm install` to get amdefine into your project.\n\n**2)** At the top of each module that uses define(), place this code:\n\n```javascript\nif (typeof define !== \'function\') { var define = require(\'amdefine\')(module) }\n```\n\n**Only use these snippets** when loading amdefine. If you preserve the basic structure,\nwith the braces, it will be stripped out when using the [RequireJS optimizer](#optimizer).\n\nYou can add spaces, line breaks and even require amdefine with a local path, but\nkeep the rest of the structure to get the stripping behavior.\n\nAs you may know, because `if` statements in JavaScript don\'t have their own scope, the var\ndeclaration in the above snippet is made whether the `if` expression is truthy or not. If\nRequireJS is loaded then the declaration is superfluous because `define` is already already\ndeclared in the same scope in RequireJS. Fortunately JavaScript handles multiple `var`\ndeclarations of the same variable in the same scope gracefully.\n\nIf you want to deliver amdefine.js with your code rather than specifying it as a dependency\nwith npm, then just download the latest release and refer to it using a relative path:\n\n[Latest Version](https://github.com/jrburke/amdefine/raw/latest/amdefine.js)\n\n### amdefine/intercept\n\nConsider this very experimental.\n\nInstead of pasting the piece of text for the amdefine setup of a `define`\nvariable in each module you create or consume, you can use `amdefine/intercept`\ninstead. It will automatically insert the above snippet in each .js file loaded\nby Node.\n\n**Warning**: you should only use this if you are creating an application that\nis consuming AMD style defined()\'d modules that are distributed via npm and want\nto run that code in Node.\n\nFor library code where you are not sure if it will be used by others in Node or\nin the browser, then explicitly depending on amdefine and placing the code\nsnippet above is suggested path, instead of using `amdefine/intercept`. The\nintercept module affects all .js files loaded in the Node app, and it is\ninconsiderate to modify global state like that unless you are also controlling\nthe top level app.\n\n#### Why distribute AMD-style nodes via npm?\n\nnpm has a lot of weaknesses for front-end use (installed layout is not great,\nshould have better support for the `baseUrl + moduleID + \'.js\' style of loading,\nsingle file JS installs), but some people want a JS package manager and are\nwilling to live with those constraints. If that is you, but still want to author\nin AMD style modules to get dynamic require([]), better direct source usage and\npowerful loader plugin support in the browser, then this tool can help.\n\n#### amdefine/intercept usage\n\nJust require it in your top level app module (for example index.js, server.js):\n\n```javascript\nrequire(\'amdefine/intercept\');\n```\n\nThe module does not return a value, so no need to assign the result to a local\nvariable.\n\nThen just require() code as you normally would with Node\'s require(). Any .js\nloaded after the intercept require will have the amdefine check injected in\nthe .js source as it is loaded. It does not modify the source on disk, just\nprepends some content to the text of the module as it is loaded by Node.\n\n#### How amdefine/intercept works\n\nIt overrides the `Module._extensions[\'.js\']` in Node to automatically prepend\nthe amdefine snippet above. So, it will affect any .js file loaded by your\napp.\n\n## define() usage\n\nIt is best if you use the anonymous forms of define() in your module:\n\n```javascript\ndefine(function (require) {\n    var dependency = require(\'dependency\');\n});\n```\n\nor\n\n```javascript\ndefine([\'dependency\'], function (dependency) {\n\n});\n```\n\n## RequireJS optimizer integration. <a name="optimizer"></name>\n\nVersion 1.0.3 of the [RequireJS optimizer](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html)\nwill have support for stripping the `if (typeof define !== \'function\')` check\nmentioned above, so you can include this snippet for code that runs in the\nbrowser, but avoid taking the cost of the if() statement once the code is\noptimized for deployment.\n\n## Node 0.4 Support\n\nIf you want to support Node 0.4, then add `require` as the second parameter to amdefine:\n\n```javascript\n//Only if you want Node 0.4. If using 0.5 or later, use the above snippet.\nif (typeof define !== \'function\') { var define = require(\'amdefine\')(module, require) }\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\n### Synchronous vs Asynchronous\n\namdefine creates a define() function that is callable by your code. It will\nexecute and trace dependencies and call the factory function *synchronously*,\nto keep the behavior in line with Node\'s synchronous dependency tracing.\n\nThe exception: calling AMD\'s callback-style require() from inside a factory\nfunction. The require callback is called on process.nextTick():\n\n```javascript\ndefine(function (require) {\n    require([\'a\'], function(a) {\n        //\'a\' is loaded synchronously, but\n        //this callback is called on process.nextTick().\n    });\n});\n```\n\n### Loader Plugins\n\nLoader plugins are supported as long as they call their load() callbacks\nsynchronously. So ones that do network requests will not work. However plugins\nlike [text](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#text) can load text files locally.\n\nThe plugin API\'s `load.fromText()` is **not supported** in amdefine, so this means\ntranspiler plugins like the [CoffeeScript loader plugin](https://github.com/jrburke/require-cs)\nwill not work. This may be fixable, but it is a bit complex, and I do not have\nenough node-fu to figure it out yet. See the source for amdefine.js if you want\nto get an idea of the issues involved.\n\n## Tests\n\nTo run the tests, cd to **tests** and run:\n\n```\nnode all.js\nnode all-intercept.js\n```\n\n## License\n\nNew BSD and MIT. Check the LICENSE file for all the details.\n',
